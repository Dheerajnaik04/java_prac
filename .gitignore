It seems your files haven't been properly staged and committed. Here's what to do:
*.class

1. First, create a `.gitignore` file to exclude compiled class files:

````text
*.class
````

2. Then run these commands in order:

````bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add .gitignore
git add .gitignore

# Add your Java file
git add Rectangle2.java

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Added Rectangle2 class with area calculation"

# Create and switch to main branch
git branch -M main

# Add remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/Dheerajnaik04/java_prac.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
````

This should properly stage, commit, and push your code while ignoring the compiled `.class` files. If you get a permission error during push, make sure you're authenticated with GitHub.
